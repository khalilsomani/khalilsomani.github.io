He also loves music too, and is most often found with his South Asian fusion a cappella group, UW Awaaz. He is excited to learn and grow so please ask him any questions that you have!</p>

                                <p>The Washington Trails Association, despite being an incredible organization, has many design flaws in its website. Using Adobe Illustrator, I rebranded the Washington Trails Association website as well as mobile landing pages and subpages for a personal project. I also created a new logo, buisness card, and visual design system. This system consisted of brand identity, brand attributes, brand colors, graphics, client overview, and a typographic system.</p>

                                <p>As a UI/UX Design Intern at Datstat, I used Adobe Illustrator and Balsamiq to wireframe and create low and high fidelity mockups of interfaces and interactions for incoming software platforms, patient portals, and client-facing applications. Here are elements from four sample projects that I have created on the job and was given permission to share.</p>
                            <h3>Patient Messenger</h3>
                                <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I designed a mobile messenger system so that patients could interact with their health care providers in the most efficient way possible. Here is one set of my wireframe progressions, focusing on setting-based interaction.</p>

As the software was, changing tasks in a given workflow caused all task information to be deleted. I designed an error message system and task/activity layout to make changing tasks and the risks of doing so more apparent to the user.</p>

This was based off of Google Material Design's onboarding principles. Here are two iterations of my design.</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/MH7GRACBV#/screens/162423631" target="_blank"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/linklightrail.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 710px"></a>
                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>After completing user research on the UW Light Rail, my team and I found satisfaction concerning time efficiency to be low. Many users are frustrated with the lack of prevalent updates concerning their commute. As a result, usage of the Light Rail is not to its maximum capacity.</p>
                            <p>To solve this, my team and I have designed a live feed of user input through a large on-site console and a mobile application platform. Users can enter comments on a Link Light Rail app that will update the live feed on the site screen as well as the feed accessible by the app. These updates are ranked by the users as well, based on the thumbs up and thumbs down symbols next to each comment. This will give users the most relevant information to make their commute as fast and efficient as possible.</p>
                            <h3>Affinity Diagramming</h3>
                            <p>We conducted user research at the light rail station and identified potential problems that the users may have with the transportation system. We then organized the problems into broad themes such as time efficiency and accessibility. Identifying themes which would enhance the user experience helped us to understand the specific problems that each of our personas would have.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Pic_1.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Personas</h3>
                            <p>We created personas, which are fictional characters created to represent the different user types. Giving a human face to otherwise abstract customers gave us a way to easily write down the characteristics, goals, desires and pains of that particular archetype. Each of the personas qualities came directly from research findings, and each persona was thorough so that a believable scenario could be created.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Pic_15.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" class="rotate90">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
                            <p>For this part of the design process, we each created two short scenarios for our given personas. Each scenario was about 3 paragraphs, and told the story of the given persona with their various motivations, goals and needs. These scenarios were essential to identify any frustrations or struggles users might have in how they interact with the space. Here is a short excerpt from one of them:</p>
                            <p style="color:blue;">Willy got stuck behind people standing in the middle of each of the three flights of escalators, and had to ask the people in front of him repeatedly and loudly to move because their headphones were in. Because of the slow people in front of him, he missed the earliest train and the next one wasn’t coming for a whole 10 minutes. He became visibly frustrated and angry, throwing up his hands when the Transit Security guard told him that he couldn’t enter the train since it was already leaving. If only there had been a way for him to get to the station faster or even just get down the three flights of escalators more quickly.</p>
                            <h3>Design Sketches</h3>
                            <p> Our design sketches involved using the 10+10 method, in which we sketched individually and in a group as well. First, each group member came up with 10 unique ideas on their own, and then iterated upon their most valuable idea 10 times. After that, the group shared these ideas, and iterated upon the best idea from the group members. Creating these sketches finally let us hone in on the design that we wanted to focus on for the project. Here is a short sketch of an idea to label train compartment enterances with a number of seats remaining.</p>

                            <h3>Storyboards</h3>
                            <p>We created 3 different storyboards, each representing a potential experience that a user might have with the product. These storyboards can help to accommodate the design of the product to potential user frustrations, so that the user experience is further enhanced. They were made after the design sketches because after honing in on a particular design, this step helps to identify problems with that design.</p>

                            <h3>Sitemap</h3>
                            <p>I felt that we needed an extra layer of organization before moving forward, and decided to create this sitemap for some clairty. This sitemap is an information architecture for the app version of our user live feed, as well as the console version. We created this to organize the flow of information, making it easy to visualize the order in which certain screens and functionalities appear, as well as where the console comes into the picture. </p>

                            <h3>Paper Prototypes</h3>
                            <p>Our paper prototypes give a physical draft of the product, illustrating all the core functionalities including button clicking, highlighting, and panel moving. We made this to see a “real-life” version of our idea, as well as a way to iterate our design based on user interaction with the prototype. We created a mobile application as well as a console, which I decided to add so that the relevance of large shifting panels could be accurately assessed. This is heavily based off of the information architecture of the sitemap. By creating this, it allowed us to understand flaws in our design as well as flaws in our understanding of user requirements.</p>

                            <p>The findings evaluation was our assessment of what need to be changed in our design based on the guerilla user research we did by taking our paper prototype to users in Odegaard and Suzzallo libraries to test it out. This was a way to make sure that we understood both the positive and negative aspects of what users saw in our product, so that we could properly make changes to our design. Our findings here told us about things like the lack of clarity in our app. It also gave us a way to alter designs to best meet the needs of the user when creating our wireframes. Here are some of the changes we made as a result, including introduction to elements and a more clear update button.</p>

                            <p>Our annotated wireframes were essentially a visualization of our full system with explanations for each key element, for example keyboards and text boxes. This was made to see what the system looks like as a whole, combining form and function into a rough version of the final mockup. Both the design itself and the descriptions of the design were based off of what we found users had trouble with during our findings evaluation. This was created using Sketch, Axure, and PowerPoint. In doing this, we created a fluid system before our final design.</p>

This was created to give an idea of a clean design that we feel could be implemented into a real, physical product. This design was created using Sketch. This design was the result of iterating our wireframes until we felt we had designed a solution to best meet user requirements, though design is never perfect nor final!</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <a href="khalilsomani.github.io/FinalReport.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/logo.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 710px"></a>
                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>	Virtual	games on phones, computers,	or gaming consoles have	dominated the gaming world,	replacing physical games with appealing	technological aspects. The problem with	these games	is that they remove	the	social experience of gaming.</p>
                            <p>Our goal was to break the conventional way of playing video games and promote social interactions as well as physical activity for an overall healthier user. We wanted to do this by creating a laser tag game that is physically interactive, can be played anywhere, and that utilizes the latest in AR technology.</p>
                            <h3>Background Research</h3>
                            <p>Before even thinking about designing a product, we needed to make sure we understood current laser tag technology as well as recent innovations in Augmented Reality. After gathering information from peer reviewed journals on the subject, which you can view in our final report, we decided to define AR as	requiring the following	three elements:</p>
                            <p>• It must combine real and virtual objects in a real environment<br>• It must run interactively in real time<br>• It must register real and virtual objects with each other</p>
                            <p>In studying pre-existing laser tag gaming and current AR systems, we decided to start with the idea of making our interface for a wearable AR headset, which we found would be a big upgrade from	current	laser tag technology, which	requires a	specific indoor	environment	and	
                                    expensive gear,	yet	is still not immersive,	customizable, or socially interactive.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/survey.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h4>Survey</h4>
                            <p>To supplement our background	research, our next step was to survey potential users in order to consider their needs during our design process. We created a short five question survey to learn	more about the opinions of prospective users about our idea and what they would	expect to see in our system. Our survey	questions were as follows:</p>
                             <p>• Would	you	be interested in playing an	augmented reality laser	tag	game?<br>• How	much would you pay for hardware	that allows	for	AR laser tag?<br>• Of the following features which is most appealing? Information about self and others (health, status, commands, etc.), Locate team members, Display virtual opponents, or Display virtual obstacles.<br>• If this system allows you to play anywhere, where would you most likely play?<br>• Have you used Microsoft HoloLens or other AR systems? If so, what are your thoughts on it?</p>
                            <p>From	our	survey,	we found that all of our participants were excited	about playing an AR	laser tag game,	but	they were not willing to pay for it. Only one would	pay	more than $60 for it. In order to keep our price point low,	we decided not to develop an entire	AR	system but instead just	a software on a	pre-existing system.</p><p> We	also learned that users	valued the	ability	to display virtual opponents and information about players (e.g. health, stamina), solidifying our decision to include both virtual	opponents and objects in our eventual design, which	we	were previously	unsure about, as well as health	and	status information using AR	technology.	We	also found	that users	would be interested	in playing in diverse locations, so	we especially wanted to make sure that our design accommodated many locations, both	indoors	and	outdoors.</p>
                            <h3>Persona</h3>

                            <p>Based on our preliminary research, we chose our target audience to be high school and undergraduate college students, around	the	ages of	14 to 22. To represent our target user population, we made a persona called	Jesse R. Johnston, our archetypical	user.</p>
                            <p>Jesse is	a 20-year-old college student who loves	gaming and nature. He grew up in the suburbs of	Detroit, where he was born.	Jesse is now a third-year design student at	the	University of Michigan. His	hobbies	include	ultimate frisbee, hiking, playing videogames, watching sports, and hanging out with	friends. His dream is to be	a game designer	working	on user	experience at a	company	that encourages	creativity and activity.</p>
                            <h4>An Average Day</h4>
                            <p>After his alarm goes	off	five times,	Jesse is running late to his AR	laser tag team practice	in the morning.	Soon after the product has been	introduced, Jesse and few of his friends started a laser tag club in his school. Now, Jesse	is the	leader of his laser	tag	team called, “Team Lazar Lamar.” The team practices	against	each other to prepare for upcoming competitions	against	other teams	(see Figure	1).</p>

                            <p>After school, Jesse goes	home for a family dinner, and he and his brother eat their food	as fast	as	they can in	order to get a few rounds of laser tag in after	dinner.	He unlocks a new weapon	and	wins the game (see Figure 3). He heads to bed after	midnight, ready	to wake	up the next	day for	practice.</p>

                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>Many of my friends and peers have had trouble finding study spaces on campus that meet all of their needs. I wanted to learn what users think about dorm, library, and classroom study spaces on campus, how they use those spaces, and how to make those spaces more effective for them. This figure is a summary of my research. If you would like to learn more about my approach and methods, keep scrolling!</p>
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Capture.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h3>Field Research</h3>
                                <p>My core approach to my field research was three deep hanging out observation sessions in three different types of study spaces; Savery Hall, Odegaard Library, and Alder Commons. I chose to do deep hanging out because I felt that integration in the environment would give me a better impression of the atmosphere, benefits, and costs of each study space. 
                                I took extensive notes of everything I was seeing in the study environment, using a laptop to blend in as well as to take notes as quickly as possible.</p>
                                <p>My note taking was broken down into observations of the setting (to give context) and observations of the users. In each space I was in, I would start by giving a description of the setting for context. I would then isolate each user in my field of vision, and describe everything I saw them doing in the study space, for example studying, playing games, or interacting with others. Upon entering each space, I made sure to choose a spot where I had access to as much user data as possible. </p>
                                <p>I used covert observation, and did not ask any of the users for consent to observe them. For the same reason as to why I did not choose to use contextual injury, I did not want to interfere with natural study/work habits by making subjects self-conscious as a result of my presence (Taylor & Bogdan, 1984). 
                                That being said, I made sure not to use any specific names or information that could link my observations to an individual.</p>
                                <p>Each of these sessions lasted 1.5 hours for a total of 4.5 hours of observations. At each site I observed three different locations for 0.5 hours each, giving me access to many different users within each space. Each 1.5 hour session was completed on a separate day at the exact same time of 9:00 PM. This approach allowed me to isolate students as my main target user (given that many students study late), and make sure that I was able to access the classroom setting as a study space and not a teaching space.</p> 
                                <p>I chose Savery, Odegaard, and Alder Commons because they are the most popular study spaces for their given study space type (classroom, library, and dorm respectively). After completing my observations at these locations, I highlighted different themes in my notes and tallied up users who fit into those themes on a separate sheet of paper to get quantitative results from my qualitative observations.</p>

                            <h3>Interviews</h3>
                                <p>The overall approach I used in my interviews was three 30 minute semi-structured interviews of three participants. 
                                In doing my interviews this way, I was able to ask questions to elicit further details, but also had a general interview structure that was consistent for each participant. I was able to ask all seven of my core questions in addition to follow up questions, which I asked based on individual responses to my core questions. </p>
                                <p>Before I conducted my interviews, I informed participants that their information would be confidential and that I would not record any identifying information. 
                                I took notes on my laptop of what each participant was saying, asking the participant to pause if I needed to catch up so I could record word for word responses. I asked permission to record these responses, and informed participants that if they felt like they did not want to answer or wanted to leave at any time they had the right to do so.</p>
                                <p>I also let them know ahead of time what the study was about and that there were no incentives involved. I attempted to be as neutral of an investigator as possible, and told the participants to be honest with their responses. This was to provide more valid data as well as reduce biases such as social desirability bias where participants may decide to provide socially acceptable answers that aren’t necessarily true, and prestige response bias where participants may try and impress me as the interviewer (Baxter, Courage, & Caine, 2005).</p>
                                <p>I recruited participants over Facebook, and constrained recruitment to current UW students. My first participant was a 21 year old female, my second was a 19 year old female, and my last was also a 19 year old female. Having only female participants of similar age gave consistency across interviews, all of which I conducted the same evening, one after another, in a Poplar Hall study room. 
                                Though conducting my research in a dorm study space was potentially biasing, it was the most convenient location for all of my subjects.</p>
                                <p>After completing the interviews, I did an Affinity Diagram, starting by identifying specific information from my interviews that could be applicable across participants. I then further specified these ideas on notecards which I organized into generalized categories. I wrote a participant ID on a card if their data was in accordance with the theme, and I finally identified four common themes based on the ideas that were shared across participants, only making inferences on themes backed by at least 2/3 of participants.</p>

                            <h3>Survey</h3>
                                <p>The recruitment process for my survey occurred over Facebook, which I chose hoping that my being friends with the participants would make them more likely to respond with honest answers. Also, since it is a popular social media platform, it made the surveys easy to access and complete. I utilized a Google Forms survey because it is an easy to use survey creation tool, including multiple question types for more varied answers and an attractive interface which I felt users would want to interact with.</p>
                                <p>I excluded participants that were not UW students and had never used a campus study space through the first two questions. By doing this I hoped to only include ideal participants, those being current UW students who specifically study using study spaces on campus, so that I could best learn about which spaces they use and how they use them.</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <a href="https://github.com/khalilsomani/khalilsomani.github.io/blob/master/img/Offical%20Responsive%20Template%20Code.html" target="_blank"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/web-trifecta_html5_css3_js-strict.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 710px"></a>
                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p> During my time as a Technical Specialist Intern at Datstat, I was asked to create a custom survey template to replace the current one. Despite it being the most up-to-date survey version, it contained many flaws in design and execution that the company felt a fellow intern and I could impove with custom Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
                            <p>The template we created is completely mobile-friendy in addition to being desktop-friendly. Below I will describe what changes and additions we implemented, and give a link to our code. Our survey template has already been integrated into the surveys of major clients and will soon be the default for Datstat Illume software.</p>
                            <h3>Major Adjustments</h3>
                            <p>Here are some of the major changes we made to the old survey template. We created a way to display survey loops in a table, which represents repeated sections of surveys that clients can ask to trigger under specific circumstances. We also used Javascript to make it so that the footer does not float up with the last question, instead always staying at the bottom of every page. This occurs even when programmers press F12 to inspect page elements. We also used custom formatting on survey prompts, response options, and titles for more fluid and appealing interaction. The first picture below is an example from the old template, and the second is from the new template we created.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <div class="grow"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Screenshot1_new.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="border:2px solid red" alt=""></div>
                            </figure>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <div class="grow"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Screenshot1_real.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="border:2px solid red" alt=""></div>
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Mobile Accordian Rendering</h3>
                            <p>In the old template, questions were not designed to be space efficient for mobile use, and it would sometimes take full minutes to scroll through response options and reach the bottom of the page. Using Javascript, we created an accordian rendering so that question prompts could be grouped together until they are tapped, at which point they would expand, revealing response options. The first picture below is the new template version before any prompts are tapped, and the second picture is the result of tapping on a prompt.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/acordian1_real1.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="width:300px" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">

                            </figure>
                            <h3>Text Elements and Buttons</h3>
                            <p>In the old survey template, text elements that were created by survey programmers took up a great deal of space, even when they didn't contain anything. We fixed that, and in addition created a way for Next, Save, and Previous buttons to be vertically displayed in mobile to reduce the need for a horizontal scroll. The first picture is an example from the old template, the second is an example from the new template illustrating reduced text element space, and the third illustrates new mobile buttons.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">

                            </figure>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">

                            </figure>

                            </figure>
                            <h3>Mobile Question Tables</h3>
                            <p>Question tables are a way to organize survey questions in a way that include multiple prompts and response option sets. In the old template, the rendering of these tables for mobile had very strange text hierarchies where inner prompts were larger than headings. We changed this to be a more user-friendly hierarchy. Here is a picture of the new, cleaner structure we came up with.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/prompt_real1.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="width:300px" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Likert Scale Questions</h3>
                            <p>On the Solutions Consulting Team, one of my main jobs was to come up with custom solutions for clients. After a client asked for a likert question scale, we realized that the old survey template did not accomodate likert scales, so we built them into the new template. Here is a picture of this new question functionality.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <div class="grow"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Screenshot4.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="border:2px solid red" alt=""></div>
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Commentaries</h3>
                            <p>Another question type is commentaries, which allow for long text entries. In the old version, there was very little space alotted for this, so we enlarged the boxes in the new template. The first picture below is an example from the old template, the second picture is from the new template.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <div class="grow"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Screenshot5_new.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="border:2px solid red" alt=""></div>

                            </figure>
                            <h3>End Page Content</h3>
                            <p>Lastly, every survey has an end page that lets the participant know they are done with the survey. The previous version said, "Thank you", but gave no more information. In our version, we used this space to provide a link so that the survey could be edited and added to by the user at a later time, including a place for the user to enter their email so that the link could be sent straight to them. The first picture below is an example of the old end page content, and the second picture is an example from our new template.</p>

                                <p>As a frequent traveler, I always wished that I could know more about what my destination will be like based on what flight I chose. To solve this, I created an application for travelers to generate a live feed of flight information which considers factors like the weather at their destination, the price of their flight, and pictures of their intended vacation spot.</p>

                                <p>My partner Alison Chiu and I accomplished this goal with Google App Engine using Python, HTML, and CSS. We incorperated three different API's in order to complete this project: Rome2rio, Wunderground, and Flickr. Take a look at our demonstration below!</p>
