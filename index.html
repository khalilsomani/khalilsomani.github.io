                    <p>My name is Khalil Somani and I am a junior at the University of Washington in Seattle, double majoring in Human Centered Design & Engineering (B.S.) and Psychology (B.S.). I am passionate about human-centered research, user-friendly design, design thinking, technical communication, and data collection/analytics. </p> 
                    <p>People are what interest me the most. I hope to use an understanding of how people think in order to create, apply, and design to the needs of the customer. In my spare time I can usually be found either on the tennis court, practicing viola, or beatboxing/singing with my South Asian fusion a cappella group UW Awaaz!</p>

                                <p>As the nation's largest state-based hiking nonprofit organization, Washington Trails Association (WTA) is the voice for hikers in Washington state. They protect hiking trails and wildlands, take volunteers out to maintain trails, and promote hiking as a healthy, fun way to explore the outdoors. I felt I could improve their design, and made it a personal project.</p>
                            <h3>UX/Graphic Design</h3>
                                <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I rebranded the WTA website as well as mobile landing pages and subpages. I also created a new logo, buisness card, and visual design system. This system consisted of brand identity, brand attributes, brand colors, graphics, client overview, and a typographic system.</p>

                                <p>Datstat is a population health company for which I am a UI/UX design intern. I use Adobe Illustrator and Balsamiq to wireframe and create hi-fidelity mockups of interfaces and interactions for incoming software platforms, patient portals, and client-facing applications. I also work to advance user experience and enhance application of use. Here are four sample projects that I have created on the job and was given permission to share.</p>
                            <h3>Patient Messenger</h3>
                                <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I designed a mobile messenger system so that patients could interact with their health care providers in the most efficient way possible. This project is currently in progress, but here is one set in my wireframe progressions thus far, focusing on setting-based interaction.</p>

As the software was, changing tasks in a given workflow caused all task information to be deleted. I designed an error message system and task/activity layout to make changing tasks and the risks of doing so more apparent to the user.</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/MH7GRACBV#/screens/162423631"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/lightrail.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 710px"></a>
                            <h3>About the Client: UW Light Rail</h3>
                            <p>After completing user research on the UW Light Rail, my team and I found user satisfaction concerning time efficiency to be low. Many users use multiple modes of transportation along with the Light Rail, and are frustrated with the lack of clarity of prevalent updates of traffic and such on their commute. Usage of the Light Rail is not to its maximum capacity because users have inadequate tools to help them have a more effective commute. To solve this, my team and I have designed a live feed of user input through a large on-site console as well as a mobile application platform. This will allow users to give other users input about problems they have run into with traffic, maintenance, the station, and the areas around the stations. Users can enter comments on a Link Light Rail app that will update the live feed on the site screen as well as the feed accessible by the app. The updates are ranked by the users as well, based on the thumbs up and thumbs down symbols next to each comment. This will give users the most relevant input to make their commute as fast and efficient as possible.</p>
                            <h3>Affinity Diagramming</h3>
                            <p>We conducted design research at the light rail station and identified potential problems that the users may have with the transportation system. We then organized the problems into broad themes such as time efficiency and accessibility. We conducted research and organized our findings into themes to better understand the main areas in which user experience could be improved at the light rail station. This was the first step in the process, and shows that design problems need to be observed before starting on a design. Identifying themes to enhance the user experience have helped us to understand the specific problems that each of our personas would have.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Pic_1.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Personas</h3>
                            <p>We created personas, which are fictional characters created to represent the different user types who will use the product. In our case, we created personas of a couple different light rail user types from our research findings. This allowed us to put human faces on abstract data about potential users from the themes that we pulled from our research. Giving a human face to otherwise abstract customers gives us a way to easily write down the characteristics, goals, desires and pains of that particular archetype. Each of the personas qualities came directly from research findings. Each persona needed to be thorough so that a believable scenario could be created.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Pic_15.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" class="rotate90">

                            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
                            <p>For this part of the design process, we each created two short scenarios for our given personas. Each scenario was about 3 paragraphs, and told the story of the given persona with their various motivations, goals and needs. The persona had to interact with the space in a way that reflected their personality. These scenarios were essential to identify any frustrations or struggles users might have in how they interact with the space. They also showed the ways the given product would be useful to society. The detailed personas were necessary in order to thoroughly understand that archetype, and to move to the next step of creating a scenario about them. The scenarios were a necessary step in the process because the design sketches reflected the problems that the personas faced in the various scenarios. Here is one of them:</p>
                            <p style="color:blue;">"Willy had a tough morning, to say the least. He had just finished a project proposal that he was extremely proud of, but his cat spilt coffee all over his papers when he wasn’t looking. (That’s why one should always have back up copies.) He had to make a small revised copy that looked really messy, which frustrated him even more, and he also tripped on a shovel that he had left outside the night before and twisted his ankle. Willy has a short temper, so he released a symphony of profanities that certainly frightened his neighbors.
                            He was late in his commute, and anxiously hobbled down from his apartment in the University District area to the UW Light Rail Station. He got stuck behind people standing in the middle of each of the three flights of escalators, and had to ask the people in front of him repeatedly and loudly to move because their headphones were in. Because of the slow people in front of him, he missed the earliest train and the next one wasn’t coming for a whole 10 minutes. He became visibly frustrated and angry, throwing up his hands when the Transit Security guard told him that he couldn’t enter the train since it was already leaving. If only there had been a way for him to get to the station faster or even just get down the three flights of escalators more quickly.
                            He nervously tapped his foot and frowned at the time on his watch, plugging in his headphones to his iPhone. He just needed some quiet space to calm himself down and listen to some music before he went off to work. He checked his emails, responding quickly on Slack to questions from his team members asking where he was, it was always a comfort for him to have his phone accessible at any moment so he could keep up to date with anything he needed to be on top of. As soon as another train came, he breathed a sigh of relief seeing that there were a lot of available seats. He tucked himself in the corner, away from other people, and reviewed his notes for the day, using up the space near him with his laptop. Arriving to work, he was late to present his project proposal and he was also frustrated and stressed from his inefficient commute, in which he was very defensive and non-receptive to critiques from his teammates. If only there had been a better and more efficient way for Willy to get to work."</p>
                            <h3>Design Sketches</h3>
                            <p> Our design sketches involved using the 10+10 method in which we sketched individually and in a group as well. First each group member came up with 10 unique ideas on their own, and then iterated upon their most valuable idea 10 times. After that, the group shared these ideas, and iterated upon the best idea from the group members. Creating these sketches finally let us hone in on the design that we wanted to focus on for the project. The design sketches came directly from the frustrations we found users faced in the scenarios. These sketches aided the next step in the process because in the storyboards, the users were shown to be interacting directly with the product that we came up with.</p>

                            <h3>Storyboards</h3>
                            <p>We created 3 different storyboards, each representing a potential experience a user might have with the product. These storyboards were created to convey the current experiences users might have with the product, as well as any problems that the user might face during this interaction. These storyboards can help to accommodate the design of the product to potential user frustrations, so that the user experience is further enhanced. They were made after the design sketches because after honing in on a particular design, this step helps to identify problems with that design. Storyboards help to identify problems so that a sitemap with the most efficient flow can be created.</p>

                            <h3>Sitemap</h3>
                            <p>This sitemap is an information architecture for the app version of our user live feed, as well as the console version. We created this to organize the flow of information, making it easy to visualize the order in which certain screens and functionalities appear, as well as where the console comes into the picture. This builds off of our design sketches in that it gives a layout of the final iteration of our design ideation. This allows us to easily create a paper prototype because each screen will be mapped to this architecture.</p>

                            <p>Our paper prototypes give a physical draft of the product, illustrating all the core functionalities including button clicking, highlighting, and panel moving. We made this to see a “real-life” version of our idea as well as a way to iterate our design based on user interaction with the prototype. We created a mobile application as well as a console. This is heavily based off of the information architecture of the sitemap. By creating this, it allowed us to understand flaws in our design as well as flaws in our understanding of user requirements, which we could access in our findings evaluation.</p>

                            <p>The findings evaluation was our assessment of what need to be changed in our design based on the guerilla user research we did by taking our paper prototype to users in Odegaard and Suzzallo libraries to test it out. This was a way to make sure that we understood both the positive and negative aspects of what users saw in our product so that we could properly make changes to our design. Our findings here told us about things like the lack of clarity in our app. It also gave us a way to alter designs to best meet the needs of the user when creating our wireframes.</p>

                            <p>Our annotated wireframes were essentially a visualization of our full system with explanations for each key element, for example keyboards and text boxes. This was made to see what the system looks like as a whole, combining form and function into a rough version of the final mockup. Both the design itself and the descriptions of the design were based off of what we found users to have trouble with during our findings evaluation. This was created using Sketch, Axure, and PowerPoint. In doing this, we created a fluid system before our final design.</p>

                            <h3>About the Client: UW Libraries</h3>
                                <p>As a student who utilizes campus study spaces myself, I know that these spaces have many different strengths, issues, and characteristics that are condusive to different kinds of studying. I wanted to learn what users think about dorm, library, and classroom study spaces on campus, and how they use these spaces.</p>
                            <p>This figure is a summary of my research. If you would like to learn more about my approach and methods, keep scrolling! Charts, reports, and detailed analysis are available upon request.</p>

                            <h3>Field Research</h3>
                                <p>My core approach to my field research was three deep hanging out observation sessions in three different types of study spaces; Savery Hall, Odegaard Library, and Alder Commons. I chose to do deep hanging out because I felt that integration in the environment would give me a better impression of the atmosphere, benefits, and costs of each study space. 
                                I took extensive notes of everything I was seeing in the study environment, using a laptop to blend in as well as to take notes as quickly as possible. My note taking was broken down into observations of the setting (to give context) and observations of the users. In each space I was in, I would start by giving a description of the setting for context. I would then isolate each user in my field of vision, and describe everything I saw them doing in the study space, for example studying, playing games, or interacting with others. Upon entering each space, I made sure to choose a spot where I had access to as much user data as possible. </p>
                                <p>I used covert observation, and did not ask any of the users for consent to observe them. For the same reason as to why I did not choose to use contextual injury, I did not want to interfere with natural study/work habits by making subjects self-conscious as a result of my presence (Taylor & Bogdan, 1984). 
                                That being said, I made sure not to use any specific names or information that could link my observations to an individual.</p>
                                <p>Each of these sessions lasted 1.5 hours for a total of 4.5 hours of observations. At each site I observed three different locations for 0.5 hours each, giving me access to many different users within each space. Each 1.5 hour session was completed on a separate day at the exact same time of 9:00 PM. This approach allowed me to isolate students as my main target user (given that many students study late), and make sure that I was able to access the classroom setting as a study space and not a teaching space. 
                                I chose Savery, Odegaard, and Alder Commons because they are the most popular study spaces for their given study space type (classroom, library, and dorm respectively). After completing my observations at these locations, I highlighted different themes in my notes and tallied up users who fit into those themes on a separate sheet of paper to get quantitative results from my qualitative observations.</p>                            
                            <h3>Interviews</h3>
                                <p>The overall approach I used in my interviews was three 30 minute semi-structured interviews of three participants. 
                                In doing my interviews this way, I was able to ask questions to elicit further details, but also had a general interview structure that was consistent for each participant. I was able to ask all seven of my core questions in addition to follow up questions, which I asked based on individual responses to my core questions. </p>
                                <p>Before I conducted my interviews, I informed participants that their information would be confidential and that I would not record any identifying information. 
                                I took notes on my laptop of what each participant was saying, asking the participant to pause if I needed to catch up so I could record word for word responses. I asked permission to record these responses, and informed participants that if they felt like they did not want to answer or wanted to leave at any time they had the right to do so. I also let them know ahead of time what the study was about and that there were no incentives involved. I attempted to be as neutral of an investigator as possible, and told the participants to be honest with their responses. This was to provide more valid data as well as reduce biases such as social desirability bias where participants may decide to provide socially acceptable answers that aren’t necessarily true, and prestige response bias where participants may try and impress me as the interviewer (Baxter, Courage, & Caine, 2005).</p>
                                <p>I recruited participants over Facebook, and constrained recruitment to current UW students. My first participant was a 21 year old female, my second was a 19 year old female, and my last was also a 19 year old female. Having only female participants of similar age gave consistency across interviews, all of which I conducted the same evening, one after another, in a Poplar Hall study room. 
                                Though conducting my research in a dorm study space was potentially biasing, it was the most convenient location for all of my subjects.</p>
                                <p>My first questions were about study environment preferences to understand the type of study space users look for and why they study there. My subsequent questions were about specific activities that users do in those spaces to understand how they are using the space. My final questions addressed comparing study spaces as well as time efficiency to get a broader perspective on how the participants view different spaces and how they use their time in those spaces.
                                After completing the interviews, I did an Affinity Diagram, starting by identifying specific information from my interviews that could be applicable across participants. I then further specified these ideas on notecards which I organized into generalized categories. I wrote a participant ID on a card if their data was in accordance with the theme, and I finally identified four common themes based on the ideas that were shared across participants, only making inferences on themes backed by at least 2/3 of participants.</p>
                            <h3>Survey</h3>
                                <p>The recruitment process for my survey occurred over Facebook, which I chose hoping that my being friends with the participants would make them more likely to respond with honest answers. Also, since it is a popular social media platform, it is easy to access and complete. I utilized a Google Forms survey because it is an easy to use survey creation tool, including multiple question types for more varied answers and an attractive interface which I felt users would want to interact with. I excluded participants that were not UW students and had never used a campus study space through the first two questions. 
                                By doing this I hoped to only include ideal participants, those being current UW students who specifically study using study spaces on campus, so that I could best learn about which spaces they use and how they use them.  A brief introduction to my survey included the purpose of the research, future goals of the research, and contact information. It mentioned all information from responders would be confidential and not linked to them in any way, and that responses were voluntary, keeping the survey ethically appropriate. I also made sure to mention in my Facebook post that there was no reward for participation. </p>
                                <p>My first question asks for the year of the participant at UW, and the next asked about the number of days per week that the participant studies at an on-campus study space. These radio button questions functioned as exclusion criteria and also allow me to compare class levels to study space use, telling me who utilized which spaces the most. 
                                The next “check all that apply” question is based on my field study and interviews. These were made to see which of library, dorm, and classroom spaces, if any, the participant uses. This was followed by a single response inquiry about which space was preferred. It was important to find out which space the user preferred, regardless of use, to better understand through later questions why they prefer that space.</p>
                                <p>The next three “check all that apply” questions ask the participant to describe library, classroom, and finally dorms spaces, offering the same response options. These were response options derived from my previous research, with the main themes of spaces being how noisy, quiet, distracting, isolating, interactive, conveniently located, aesthetically pleasing, and open/available they are. The survey then asks how social/interactive the participant likes to be in a study space. 
                                This was a rank question so participants could choose their level of social/interactive statements to best discover what the user thinks about themselves in terms of how interactive they enjoy being when studying. The next few ranked questions explored my previous research that more noise was preferred for easier work and less for difficult work, hoping to see how this was related to thoughts about how much the user liked to be social/interactive. The final radio button questions asked for a preferred study method and primary method of study space distraction. Seeing how people are studying in different study spaces, and how they distract themselves in those spaces gives a comprehensive cost/benefit view of each space.</p>
                                <p>Finally I created a summary report based on my findings, which I have provided for you to check out! This is the short version, but if you are interested in more details on my process shoot me an email and I would love to share my full reports and analysis.</p>

                                <p>Along with my partner, I created an application for travelers to create a live feed of flight information to allow their customers to plan a trip by considering factors like the weather at their destination, the price of their flight, and pictures of their intended vacation spot.</p>

                                <p>We accomplished this with Google App Engine using Python, HTML, and CSS. We incorperated three different API's in order to complete this project: Rome2rio, Wunderground, and Flickr. Take a look at our demonstration below!</p>
