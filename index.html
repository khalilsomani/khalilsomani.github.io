I am passionate about human-centered research, user-friendly design and design thinking, technical communication, and data collection/analytics. </p> 
                    <p>People are what interest me the most. I hope to use an understanding of how people think in order to create, apply, and design to the needs of the customer. In my spare time I can usually be found either on the tennis court, practicing viola, or beatboxing and singing with my South Asian fusion a cappella group UW Awaaz!</p>

                                <p>As the nation's largest state-based hiking nonprofit organization, Washington Trails Association (WTA) is the voice for hikers in Washington state. They protect hiking trails and wildlands, take volunteers out to maintain trails, and promote hiking as a healthy, fun way to explore the outdoors.</p>
                            <h3>Service: UX/Graphic Design</h3>
                                <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I rebranded the WTA website as well as mobile landing pages and subpages. I also created a new logo, buisness card, and visual design system. This system consisted of brand identity, brand attributes, brand colors, graphics, client overview, and a typographic system.</p>

                                <p>Datstat is a population health company for which I am a UI/UX design intern. I use Adobe Illustrator and Balsamiq to wireframe and create hi-fidelity mockups of interfaces and interactions for incoming software platforms, patient portals, and client-facing applications. I also work to advance user experience and enhance application of use. Here are four sample projects that I have created on the job, and was given permission to share.</p>
                            <h3>Service: Patient Messenger</h3>
                                <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I designed a mobile messenger system so that patients could interact with their health care providers in the most efficient way possible. This project is currently in progress, but here is my wireframe progression thus far, 
                                running with two different ideas and sample static interactions. The first idea is a setting based interaction and the second a slide based interaction.</p>

                                <p>Using Balsamiq, I desiged a solution to a software issue for a desktop client, and the wireframe interaction process is shown. As the software was, changing tasks in a given workflow caused all task information to be deleted. I designed an error message system and task/activity layout to make changing tasks and the risks of doing so more apparent to the user.
                                The steps are as follows: Create a new task (leads to a task type display on the UI), Change task, Appereance of warning.</p>

                                <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I designed a Top User Benefits introduction to the UI for what users will see after opening a mobile app for a new patient portal, introducing them to the functionalities of the UI. This was based off of Google Material Design's onboarding principles. Here are two iterations of my design.</p>

                            <h3>About the Client: UW Libraries</h3>
                                <p>As a student who utilizes campus study spaces myself, I know that these spaces have many different strengths, issues, and characteristics that are condusive to different kinds of studying. I wanted to learn what users think about Dorm, Library, and Classroom study spaces on campus and how they use these spaces.</p>
                            <h3>Service: Field Research</h3>
                                <p>My core approach to my field research was three deep hanging out observation sessions in three different types of study spaces; Savery Hall, Odegaard Library, and Alder Commons. I chose to do deep hanging out because I felt that integration in the environment would give me a better impression of the atmosphere, benefits, and costs of each study space. 
                                I took extensive notes of everything I was seeing in the study environment, using a laptop to blend in as well as to take notes as quickly as possible. My note taking was broken down into observations of the setting (to give context) and observations of the users. In each space I was in, I would start by giving a description of the setting for context. I would then isolate each user in my field of vision, and describe everything I saw them doing in the study space, for example studying, playing games, or interacting with others. Upon entering each space, I made sure to choose a spot where I had access to as much user data as possible. </p>
                                <p>I used covert observation, and did not ask any of the users for consent to observe them. For the same reason as to why I did not choose to use contextual injury, I did not want to interfere with natural study/work habits by making subjects self-conscious as a result of my presence (Taylor & Bogdan, 1984). 
                                That being said, I made sure not to use any specific names or information that could link my observations to an individual.</p>
                                <p>Each of these sessions lasted 1.5 hours for a total of 4.5 hours of observations. At each site I observed three different locations for 0.5 hours each, giving me access to many different users within each space. Each 1.5 hour session was completed on a separate day at the exact same time of 9:00 PM. This approach allowed me to isolate students as my main target user (given that many students study late), and make sure that I was able to access the classroom setting as a study space and not a teaching space. 
                                I chose Savery, Odegaard, and Alder Commons because they are the most popular study spaces for their given study space type (classroom, library, and dorm respectively). After completing my observations at these locations, I highlighted different themes in my notes and tallied up users who fit into those themes on a separate sheet of paper to get quantitative results from my qualitative observations.</p>                            
                            <h3>Service: Interviews</h3>
                                <p>The overall approach I used in my interviews was three 30 minute semi-structured interviews of three participants. 
                                In doing my interviews this way, I was able to ask questions to elicit further details, but also had a general interview structure that was consistent for each participant. I was able to ask all seven of my core questions in addition to follow up questions, which I asked based on individual responses to my core questions. </p>
                                <p>Before I conducted my interviews, I informed participants that their information would be confidential and that I would not record any identifying information. 
                                I took notes on my laptop of what each participant was saying, asking the participant to pause if I needed to catch up so I could record word for word responses. I asked permission to record these responses, and informed participants that if they felt like they did not want to answer or wanted to leave at any time they had the right to do so. I also let them know ahead of time what the study was about and that there were no incentives involved. I attempted to be as neutral of an investigator as possible, and told the participants to be honest with their responses. This was to provide more valid data as well as reduce biases such as social desirability bias where participants may decide to provide socially acceptable answers that aren’t necessarily true, and prestige response bias where participants may try and impress me as the interviewer (Baxter, Courage, & Caine, 2005).</p>
                                <p>I recruited participants over Facebook, and constrained recruitment to current UW students. My first participant was a 21 year old female, my second was a 19 year old female, and my last was also a 19 year old female. Having only female participants of similar age gave consistency across interviews, all of which I conducted the same evening, one after another, in a Poplar Hall study room. 
                                Though conducting my research in a dorm study space was potentially biasing, it was the most convenient location for all of my subjects.</p>
                                <p>My first questions were about study environment preferences to understand the type of study space users look for and why they study there. My subsequent questions were about specific activities that users do in those spaces to understand how they are using the space. My final questions addressed comparing study spaces as well as time efficiency to get a broader perspective on how the participants view different spaces and how they use their time in those spaces.
                                After completing the interviews, I did an Affinity Diagram, starting by identifying specific information from my interviews that could be applicable across participants. I then further specified these ideas on notecards which I organized into generalized categories. I wrote a participant ID on a card if their data was in accordance with the theme, and I finally identified four common themes based on the ideas that were shared across participants, only making inferences on themes backed by at least 2/3 of participants.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The recruitment process for my survey occurred over Facebook, which I chose hoping that my being friends with the participants would make them more likely to respond with honest answers. Also, since it is a popular social media platform, it is easy to access and complete. I utilized a Google Forms survey because it is an easy to use survey creation tool, including multiple question types for more varied answers and an attractive interface which I felt users would want to interact with. I excluded participants that were not UW students and had never used a campus study space through the first two questions. 
                                By doing this I hoped to only include ideal participants, those being current UW students who specifically study using study spaces on campus, so that I could best learn about which spaces they use and how they use them.  A brief introduction to my survey included the purpose of the research, future goals of the research, and contact information. It mentioned all information from responders would be confidential and not linked to them in any way, and that responses were voluntary, keeping the survey ethically appropriate. I also made sure to mention in my Facebook post that there was no reward for participation. </p>
                                <p>My first question asks for the year of the participant at UW, and the next asked about the number of days per week that the participant studies at an on-campus study space. These radio button questions functioned as exclusion criteria and also allow me to compare class levels to study space use, telling me who utilized which spaces the most. 
                                The next “check all that apply” question is based on my field study and interviews. These were made to see which of library, dorm, and classroom spaces, if any, the participant uses. This was followed by a single response inquiry about which space was preferred. It was important to find out which space the user preferred, regardless of use, to better understand through later questions why they prefer that space.</p>
                                <p>The next three “check all that apply” questions ask the participant to describe library, classroom, and finally dorms spaces, offering the same response options. These were response options derived from my previous research, with the main themes of spaces being how noisy, quiet, distracting, isolating, interactive, conveniently located, aesthetically pleasing, and open/available they are. The survey then asks how social/interactive the participant likes to be in a study space. 
                                This was a rank question so participants could choose their level of social/interactive statements to best discover what the user thinks about themselves in terms of how interactive they enjoy being when studying. The next few ranked questions explored my previous research that more noise was preferred for easier work and less for difficult work, hoping to see how this was related to thoughts about how much the user liked to be social/interactive. The final radio button questions asked for a preferred study method and primary method of study space distraction. Seeing how people are studying in different study spaces, and how they distract themselves in those spaces gives a comprehensive cost/benefit view of each space.</p>
                                <p>Finally I created a summary report based on my findings, which I have provided for you to check out! This is the short version, but if you are interested in more details on my process shoot me an email and I would love to share my full reports and analysis! This diagram sums up my results.</p>
