                    <p>Khalil is amazing and you should hire him. Why? Because he's cool to work with and a team player. He graduated from the University of Washington double majoring in Human Centered Design & Engineering (B.S.) and Psychology (B.S.). He loves creating the most user-friendly designs possible and doing user research that strengthens and supports that design.</p> 
                    <p>He is a people person. He understands how people think and uses this to always put the user first. He also loves music too, and is most often found busking with his string quartet or with his South Asian fusion a cappella group, UW Awaaz. He is excited to learn and grow so please ask him any questions that you have!</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/MH7GRACBV#/screens/162423631" target="_blank"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/linklightrail.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 710px"></a>
                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>After completing user research on the UW Light Rail, my team and I found satisfaction concerning time efficiency to be low. Many users are frustrated with the lack of prevalent updates concerning their commute. As a result, usage of the Light Rail is not to its maximum capacity.</p>
                            <p>To solve this, my team and I have designed a live feed of user input through a large on-site console and a mobile application platform. Users can enter comments on a Link Light Rail app that will update the live feed on the site screen as well as the feed accessible by the app. These updates are ranked by the users as well, based on the thumbs up and thumbs down symbols next to each comment. This will give users the most relevant information to make their commute as fast and efficient as possible.</p>
                            <h3>Affinity Diagramming</h3>
                            <p>We conducted user research at the light rail station and identified potential problems that the users may have with the transportation system. We then organized the problems into broad themes such as time efficiency and accessibility. Identifying themes which would enhance the user experience helped us to understand the specific problems that each of our personas would have.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Pic_1.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Personas</h3>
                            <p>We created personas, which are fictional characters created to represent the different user types. Giving a human face to otherwise abstract customers gave us a way to easily write down the characteristics, goals, desires and pains of that particular archetype. Each of the personas qualities came directly from research findings, and each persona was thorough so that a believable scenario could be created.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Pic_15.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" class="rotate90">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
                            <p>For this part of the design process, we each created two short scenarios for our given personas. Each scenario was about 3 paragraphs, and told the story of the given persona with their various motivations, goals and needs. These scenarios were essential to identify any frustrations or struggles users might have in how they interact with the space. Here is a short excerpt from one of them:</p>
                            <p style="color:blue;">Willy got stuck behind people standing in the middle of each of the three flights of escalators, and had to ask the people in front of him repeatedly and loudly to move because their headphones were in. Because of the slow people in front of him, he missed the earliest train and the next one wasn’t coming for a whole 10 minutes. He became visibly frustrated and angry, throwing up his hands when the Transit Security guard told him that he couldn’t enter the train since it was already leaving. If only there had been a way for him to get to the station faster or even just get down the three flights of escalators more quickly.</p>
                            <h3>Design Sketches</h3>
                            <p> Our design sketches involved using the 10+10 method, in which we sketched individually and in a group as well. First, each group member came up with 10 unique ideas on their own, and then iterated upon their most valuable idea 10 times. After that, the group shared these ideas, and iterated upon the best idea from the group members. Creating these sketches finally let us hone in on the design that we wanted to focus on for the project. Here is a short sketch of an idea to label train compartment enterances with a number of seats remaining.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Pic_14.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Storyboards</h3>
                            <p>We created 3 different storyboards, each representing a potential experience that a user might have with the product. These storyboards can help to accommodate the design of the product to potential user frustrations, so that the user experience is further enhanced. They were made after the design sketches because after honing in on a particular design, this step helps to identify problems with that design.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">

                            </figure>
                            <h3>Sitemap</h3>
                            <p>I felt that we needed an extra layer of organization before moving forward, and decided to create this sitemap for some clairty. This sitemap is an information architecture for the app version of our user live feed, as well as the console version. We created this to organize the flow of information, making it easy to visualize the order in which certain screens and functionalities appear, as well as where the console comes into the picture. </p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">

                            </figure>
                            <h3>Paper Prototypes</h3>
                            <p>Our paper prototypes give a physical draft of the product, illustrating all the core functionalities including button clicking, highlighting, and panel moving. We made this to see a “real-life” version of our idea, as well as a way to iterate our design based on user interaction with the prototype. We created a mobile application as well as a console, which I decided to add so that the relevance of large shifting panels could be accurately assessed. This is heavily based off of the information architecture of the sitemap. By creating this, it allowed us to understand flaws in our design as well as flaws in our understanding of user requirements.</p>

                            <h3>Findings Evaluation</h3>
                            <p>The findings evaluation was our assessment of what need to be changed in our design based on the guerilla user research we did by taking our paper prototype to users in Odegaard and Suzzallo libraries to test it out. This was a way to make sure that we understood both the positive and negative aspects of what users saw in our product, so that we could properly make changes to our design. Our findings here told us about things like the lack of clarity in our app. It also gave us a way to alter designs to best meet the needs of the user when creating our wireframes. Here are some of the changes we made as a result, including introduction to elements and a more clear update button.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Pic_7.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Annotated Wireframes</h3>
                            <p>Our annotated wireframes were essentially a visualization of our full system with explanations for each key element, for example keyboards and text boxes. This was made to see what the system looks like as a whole, combining form and function into a rough version of the final mockup. Both the design itself and the descriptions of the design were based off of what we found users had trouble with during our findings evaluation. This was created using Sketch, Axure, and PowerPoint. In doing this, we created a fluid system before our final design.</p>

                            <p>The high fidelity mockup that we created is a final design iteration of the link light rail user live feed. This was created to give an idea of a clean design that we feel could be implemented into a real, physical product. This design was created using Sketch. This design was the result of iterating our wireframes until we felt we had designed a solution to best meet user requirements, though design is never perfect nor final!</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <a href="khalilsomani.github.io/FinalReport.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/logo.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 710px"></a>
                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>	Virtual	games on phones, computers,	and gaming consoles are starting to dominate the gaming world, replacing physical games with new, immersive technology. The problem with these games is that they remove much of the social experience of gaming.</p>
                            <p>Our goal was to break down the conventional way of playing video games and promote social interactions as well as physical activity for an overall healthier user. We wanted to do this by creating a laser tag game that is physically interactive, can be played anywhere, and that utilizes the latest in AR technology.</p>
                            <br><h3>Background Research</h3>
                            <p>Before even thinking about designing a product, we needed to make sure we understood current laser tag technology as well as recent innovations in Augmented Reality. After gathering information from peer reviewed journals on the subject, which you can view in our final report, we decided to define AR as	requiring the following	three elements:</p>
                            <br><p>• It must combine real and virtual objects in a real environment<br>• It must run interactively in real time<br>• It must register real and virtual objects with each other</p>
                            <br><p>In studying pre-existing laser tag gaming and current AR systems, we decided to start with the idea of making our interface for a wearable AR headset, which we found would be a big upgrade from current laser tag technology, which requires a	specific indoor	environment, expensive gear, and is still not immersive or customizable.</p>

                            <h4>Survey</h4>
                            <p>To add to our background	research, our next step was to survey potential users in order to consider their needs during our design process. We created a short five question survey to learn	more about the opinions of prospective users and what they would expect to see in our system. Our survey questions were as follows:</p>
                            <br><p>• Would	you	be interested in playing an	augmented reality laser	tag	game?<br>• How	much would you pay for hardware	that allows	for	AR laser tag?<br>• Of the following features which is most appealing? Information about self and others (health, status, commands, etc.), Locating team members, Displaying virtual opponents, or Displaying virtual obstacles?<br>• If this system allows you to play anywhere, where would you most likely play?<br>• Have you used Microsoft HoloLens or other AR systems? If so, what are your thoughts?</p>
                            <br><p>From	our	survey,	we found that all of our participants were excited	about playing an AR	laser tag game,	but	they were not willing to pay for it (only one would	pay	more than $60). In order to keep our price point low, we decided not to develop an entire AR system but instead just the software to be implemented on a pre-existing system.</p><p> We	also learned that users	valued the	ability	to display virtual opponents and information about players (e.g. health, stamina), solidifying our decision to include both virtual	opponents and objects in our eventual design, which	we	were previously	unsure about, as well as health	and	status information.	We also found that users would be interested in playing in diverse locations, so we especially wanted to make sure that our design accommodated many locations, both indoors and outdoors.</p>

                            <p>Based on our preliminary research, we chose our target audience to be high school and undergraduate college students, around	the	ages of	14 to 22. To represent our target user population, we made a persona called	Jesse R. Johnston, our archetypical	user.</p>
                            <p>Jesse is	a 20-year-old college student who loves	gaming and nature. He grew up in the suburbs of	Detroit, where he was born.	Jesse is now a third-year design student at	the	University of Michigan. His	hobbies	include	ultimate frisbee, hiking, playing videogames, watching sports, and hanging out with	friends. His dream is to be	a game designer	working	on user	experience at a	company	that encourages	creativity and activity.</p>
                            <br><h4>An Average Day With LAZAR Technology</h4>
                            <p>After his alarm goes	off	five times,	Jesse is running late to his AR	laser tag team practice	in the morning.	Soon after the product had been	introduced, Jesse and few of his friends started a laser tag club in his school. Now, Jesse	is the	leader of his laser	tag	team called, “Team Lazar Lamar.” The team practices	against	each other to prepare for upcoming competitions	against	rival teams	(see Figure	1).</p>

                            <p>After school, Jesse goes	home for a family dinner, and he and his brother eat their food	as fast	as	they can in	order to get a few rounds of laser tag in after	dinner.	He unlocks a new weapon	and	wins the game (see Figure 3). He heads to bed after	midnight, ready	to wake	up the next	day for	practice.</p>

                            <h3>Design Priorities</h3>
                            <p>After completing our storyboards, we came up with design priorities that we felt were very important to include given the "experiences" of our persona.</p>
                            <br><h4>3D Gaming Interface</h4>
                            <p>Our main	priority was to	stay away from the traditional two-dimensional gaming interface design, involving clicking on buttons and menus. To make our product intuitive for AR, we wanted to	focus on physical movement and large-scale gestures, such as swiping with one's	arm	to move	through	a carousel of selections to	choose a game. This	would allow	our	interface to be	interactive	rather than a stationary experience.</p>
                            <br><h4>Self-Contained Gameplay</h4>
                            <p>Though our experience will be interactive and flexible to the environment it	is in, it is impossible	to remove all the unpredictable	variables from gameplay, such as people	walking	around and moving obstacles like cars, bikes, etc. It became a priority to	find a way to indicate to users	who	is in the game so they could remain immersed and so others not involved in the game would not be disturbed or targeted.</p>
                            <br><h4>Location</h4>
                            <p>We want our users to have the ability to play LAZAR in any location. Some environments may have more physical obstacles than others, so in order to compensate for perhaps less physical obstacles being present, we wanted virtual objects which could replace real world objects in order to still give users places to hide and interact with.</p>
                            <h3>Task Analysis</h3>
                            <p>After figuring out our prorities in design and functionality, we needed to figure out design requirements and user tasks to test. To design the experience of each task, we started out with flowcharts for each one until we had a sitemap which could represent our overall information architecture.</p>
                            <br><h4>Design Requirements</h4>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/five_components.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <p>We decided that we needed to allow the user to set up and play a game of LAZAR, in addition to:<br><br>1. Calibration with the environment<br>2. Using health indicators<br>3. Using a physical trigger system<br>4. Team identification<br>5. Creating virtual obstacles/opponents</p><br>
                            <h4>3 Main User Testing Tasks</h4>
                            <p>• Complete a tutorial of the game<br>• Create a new game with both virtual opponents and obstacles<br>• Join a game created by a friend nearby</p><br>
                            <h4>Task 1: Tutorial Mode Flow Chart</h4>

                            <br><h3>Design Iterations</h3>
                            <p>During our project, we made three iterations	of our design in order to test our interface design	and	overall	concept.</p>
                            <br><h4>First Iteration</h4>
                            <p>Our first iteration was our first attempt at	creating an interface design for a three-dimensional game in a two-dimensional form. We presented each screen on paper and flipped between pages while holding them in front of our users to emulate an AR experience.</p>
                            <p>Some	notable	screens	from our first iteration are the calibration screen, the menu screen, and the create game screen. On our first attempt at the calibration screen, we wanted	to suggest that	users should explore their surroundings. We	used arrows	to indicate	that the user should do so; however, our users only	turned their head side to side instead of turning all the way around (see Figure 5).</p>
                            <br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/figure5.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <p>Our original	menu screen	implemented	a carousel-style scrolling system (see Figure 6). As mentioned	before,	we eventually divided into a main menu and submenu to lessen the amount	of scrolling needed	by users. We also realized that having buttons below the menu options was pointless as the actual menu options could act as buttons themselves, minimizing our design and making it easier for users to move through.</p>
                            <br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/figure6.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <p>The last	screen we focused on was our ‘Create Game’ screen. Our original idea used buttons to set the amount of players, but we realized this did not fit with our priority to avoid common gaming interface design (see Figure 7). Furthermore, our users were confused on whether to press the buttons or the icons next to the buttons. Lastly, they were not sure whether there should be different amounts of virtual obstacles rather than simply either virtual obstacles or no virtual obstacles.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/figure7.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h4>Second Iteration</h4>
                            <p>For our second iteration, we	attempted to make a	higher fidelity	mockup of our final	design in order to give	users a	better feel for	using AR. However, we were met with	technical restraints which made it difficult to	make a full	prototype using	the	AR technology. We were able	to make	the	menu and the ‘Create Game’ screen, as well as a way to add obstacles and virtual opponents (see Figure 8). Though there were buttons on our mockup, they were meant to represent gestures though we could not do so with the technical constraints of Google Tango.</p>
                            <br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/figure8.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <p>Though this mockup had less functionality than our previous one, it articulated more	clearly	to the users what we were trying to	achieve, and they found	the	system more interesting	to use than	our	previous iteration. However, in	order to get more useful feedback, we decided that showing our users this iteration along with a low-fidelity third	iteration would	be most	helpful	in getting  specific advice	of what	to change about	our	prototype.</p>
                            <br><h4>Third Iteration</h4>
                            <p>Our final iteration was a low-fidelity paper prototype application, because as it was previously mentioned, our initial iterations were very high-fidelity but left us with questions on simpler interactions that still needed to be assessed by users. We paired this with our second iteration in order to give our users a feel of AR so that they could understand our paper prototype better. The fully functional paper prototype can be accessed <a href="http://bit.ly/2gF8YlS" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                            <br><figure style="display:inline-block">

                            </figure>
                            <h3>User Testing</h3>
                            <p>To make changes, it was critical that we tested our technology with	potential users	and get a sense of how our design was functioning. We did two rounds of testing, with each round also having a pre-testing period to fix any major issues before officially testing. We tested five people per round for the official testing. Our first testing round was with the first iteration of our design and the second was with our second iteration. While testing we measured the time it took to complete each task, the likability on a scale to 10, and the difficulty on a scale to 10 (see Table 1).</p>
                            <p>After our two rounds	of testing, our	second testing results improved	from our first testing results because the users were less confused, quicker at	completing our tasks, and more satisfied as	far	as what	the	technology was capable of doing. The average time per task went	down by	about a	minute in our second iteration (see	Figure 10).</p>
                            <br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/qualitative.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <p>Our second iteration	was	more likeable partially	because	many of	our	testing	subjects were impressed	with the implementation	of AR technology in	our	mockup.	They also found	it easier to complete tasks	when flipping through paper	pages was not necessary	(see Table 1).</p>
                            <br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/table.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Design Changes</h3>
                            <p>With	the	suggestions	from our users,	we made	several	changes	for	our	third and final	iteration. To make tasks more clear, we	made the ending	calibration	screen say “Continue” rather than “Start,” so that our users know the game is not starting yet (see	Figure 11).</p>
                            <br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/changes1.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <p>We split	the	“Create	Game” screen into two screens—one that sets the	parameters for the game	and	one	that shows who is on what team while waiting for other players to join.	We also	made it	so	that if spaces were	not	filled by real players,	they were automatically	filled by virtual players. We split	the	menus, one for a general menu and one for the game play menu, to make our menus easier to scroll through (see Figure 12). We also added back buttons so users could	navigate more easily if	they made a	mistake	when first navigating (see Figure 9). Making these changes added extra directional options to give more	clarity	to users as	far	as what	to do in order to proceed to the next step,	and	the	users were able	to proceed with different tasks much more quickly.</p>
                            <br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/changes2.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Reflection</h3>
                            <p>I was very fortunate to get to work on this project, especailly because I learned a lot about design errors that can happen later in the UCD process. Making an amazing high-fidelity wireframe is great, but not if it makes assumptions about how users like interactions and functionalities. This is why our last iteration had to be lower-fidelity, so that our user testing met the standards of our design, and so we could get user feedback on items that were becoming too hi-fi to build within the given time constraint. We were proud of our initial designs, and wanted to be equally proud of our user research and prototype.</p>
                            <p>This was also an excellent experience because I got to work on this project with an Industrial Engineering major and a Computer Science major, which is uncommon for class projects. It allowed me to utilize our varying skillsets in the best way possible, and also taught me how to work with people from diverse backgrounds to design with a process that was both innovative and holistic.</p>

                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p> We performed a usability test on the Microsoft Outlook Calendar, more specifically the web version of Outlook on PC. The Outlook calendar has many uses, some of which include allowing a user to create events and inviting other people to events. We found some issues with this UI, and decided to test the usability of the Outlook calendar by testing the overall ease of moving through Outlook calendar functionalities, such as editing, sharing, and adding events.</p>
                            <p>In our test, we specifically focused on learning how a user navigates to the calendar, creates and saves a calendar event, edits and customizes an event, adds a charm, combines a calendar, and creates a calendar event from an email. To perform these tasks, we screened and recruited participants, then had them run through specific parts of the interface while we captured their audio and screen data using Morae. After that, we analyzed our data and wrote our findings up in a report.</p>
                            <br><h3>Participants</h3>
                            <p>For this study, we recruited eight test participants. We recruited an equal number of new users and experienced users of Outlook. We defined experienced users as people who have used Outlook at least three times for academic, professional, or personal reasons, and have an Outlook account. New users were defined as people who had never used Outlook before. Our target users were undergraduate students, and we recruited them with a screening questionnaire via social media (Facebook). Gender and age were not important factors in recruitment. The demographic information of the participants was then recorded and can be seen below:</p>

                            <p>For our test, we had the participants go through six different tasks, which originated from our heuristic evaluations. In these evaulations, we parsed through designs and functionalities of the Outlook calendar individually and in a group, and came up with tasks based on common errors found. Below are the six tasks we devised for users following the evaluation.</p>

                            <br><h3>Set-Up</h3>
                            <p> We chose Morae as our usability testing software, and installed it on a two of our team member’s laptops. While recording, Morae captures both the screen and the participant’s face. Since the built-in camera on the laptop was compatible with Morae, we did not need to find another webcam for Morae. After that, we also made sure that the Google Chrome web browser on each laptop was up to date and was working properly with Outlook.com. By logging into Outlook.com using the alias ID, we checked whether everything would run smoothly before each testing session.</p>
                            <p>Before conducting usability tests for the actual data and recordings, we conducted a pilot test to identify any problems that might arise. This pilot test allowed us to test our software and other parts of our usability testing kit. We observed what worked and what did not, and used the results to help modify our future usability tests.</p>

                            <br><br><h3>Procedures</h3>
                            <p>We briefed the participants about the test and then asked the participants to sign a consent form, allowing us to use the data collected, and giving us permission to record the participants during the test. Participants were notified that they had the right to withdraw from the testing at any point without any questions asked and could stop whenever they need a break. We wanted to ensure that the participants felt at ease during the test to replicate a normal environment in which they might use the product. This is what our script looked like:</p>

                            <br><br><p>Once the participant signed the consent form, the participants took a pre-test questionnaire. We then started the recording and began going through the different tasks. The moderator read out the tasks and was there to prompt the participants if they needed help. Participants were asked to think aloud while they were going through the task so that we could record and understand their decision process. After each task was complete, the participants were then asked to complete a post-task questionnaire. Tests took an average of 20 minutes. Here are the pre-test and post-task questionnaires:</p>

                            <br><br><br><p>After the six tasks were complete, the participants were asked to take a post-test questionnaire so we could get a sense of the overall experience using the calendar. Participants were then asked whether they had any last questions before we thanked them and escorted them out. At the end of each test, the usability team came together for a quick debrief of findings and thoughts. The notes were polished and uploaded on a folder for later analysis. Here is the post-test questionnaire:</p>

                            <p>We took both qualitative and quantitative approaches to identify the major findings. Qualitatively, we wrote the individual findings for each usability study session onto sticky notes and performed affinity diagram analysis. Through affinity diagramming, we identified several major themes by grouping the individual findings together. Quantitatively, for each theme, we calculated the number of participants that had behaviors or observations that related to the given theme. Here is the task list for our results:</p>

                            <p>Based on the number of participants involved in each theme, we ranked themes with different severities: the more participants struggled with a certain theme, the higher severity that theme would have, while prioirty represented the order in which the themes needed to be fixed. For both severity and priority, 1 was the highest and 4 was the lowest. We used the themes with severity ratings in our finalized findings. Here are the results from each task:</p>

                            <br><p>Our results show that saving a created event, adding a calender, setting an event status, and understanding the purpose of charms were the most common mistakes whether or not the user was new to Outlook. 
                            <br><br><h4>Saving a Created Event</h4>
                            <p>Five out of eight participants had trouble saving a created event (Severity 1, Priority 1). Participants were asked to set a biweekly meeting from the current date to a due date of January 17, 2017. As shown in the graphs, seven out of eight participants had trouble with this task, this included both experienced and inexperienced users. Five out of eight participants set the “End” date as the due date of January 17, 2017. The event is only able to be saved after participants selected Repeat, and completed the option to fill out a “To:” textbox which was then offered for the due date. Most participants did not fill this if they already filled out the ”Start” textbox with today’s date and the “End” textbox with January 17, 2017. As a result, Outlook did not save the event onto the Outlook calendar. Outlook did not provide any reason for why the event did not save, and the user only noticed once they saw on the Calendar that the event was not present.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/lack_of_feedback_old.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <br><p>The recommendation we have made for this issue is to show error messages when the user is not doing or saving something correctly. When the user does not select an end date for the recurring section of the event, it would be beneficial to have an error message saying "No 'To date' selected, event cannot be saved". This will allow the user to see they have missed a part of the event creation, and they can immediately input a date and save the event successfully. </p>

                            <br><h4>Adding a Calendar</h4>
                            <p>Adding a calendar is a way to synch other events to your calendar, for example synching the Seahawks game schedule to your calendar so that you can see when every Seahawks game is. When users tried to add the Seahawks game schedule to the calendars in our test, they were confused upon seeing, “Secondary Calendars”, “Holiday Calendars”, and “Interesting Calendars” as their only options, and it was not clear to them that they needed to go to “Interesting Calendars” to find sports related calendars. Most users figured this out, but it took a few tries or lead to moments of confusion (Severity 3, Priority 1). </p>
                            <br><br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/terminology.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <br><br><p>During this task, users tended to manually add in the schedule by looking up game schedule and creating a new event. Users also tended to search for a calendar (ex. Seahawks) to import into the calendar because they did not know that the interesting calendars were a function. All of the four inexperienced users had a problem saving the Seahawks calendar to the primary calendar, but only two of the experienced users had trouble with this task. The “Interesting Calendar” was a little ambiguous, especially for the inexperienced users, and users did not know what this tool was used for.</p>
                            <br><br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/terminology_old.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <br><br><p>The recommendation we have for this is to rename the extra calendar features to make them more clear to the user. For example, for the sports calendar function could be renamed “Entertainment Calendar” so that the user doesn't have to find it in the “Interesting Calendar” section. Separating parts of this section out and removing the "Interesting" category would make options more clear to the user.</p>
                            <br><br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/terminology_new.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <br><br><h4>Setting the Status of an Event</h4>
                            <p>When creating a calendar event, the user was shown to be “Busy” by default. When the purpose of an event was to show others that the user is available, the user typically did not know to change “Busy” to “Free” (Severity 4, Priority 4). This was of a lower severity and priority because only two out of the eight participants were unsure about what the status being “Busy” meant, as shown in the results list. However, all four inexperienced participants had trouble customizing the event, as shown in Graph 1, and were not sure about changing the status of the event. If the user did not see this option, it would block out a whole chunk of time which the user might want to have for additional activities.</p>
                            <br><br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/busy.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <p>Since the user typically did not notice this as an option to change, we recommend to make it be a required selection to save an event. We also recommend having the default for the status to be initially empty, so that the user has to physically set a status. If the user did not notice the option for this before saving the event, an error message like the one mentioned earlier should pop up saying, “No status was selected, event cannot be saved”. This will make the status more clear to the user.</p>
                            <br><h4>Purpose of Charms</h4>
                            <br><br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/function_of_charms.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <br><p>Two participants questioned the purpose of the charms. First, the meaning of the word “charm” did not make any sense to them. They would prefer more representative and intuitive expressions such as icons. Secondly, the charms did not show on the monthly calendar, they only showed up on the right side of the website and were too small to catch the attention of the user (Severity 4, Priority 3). When asked to add Charms to a birthday event, some participants just created a birthday event on the “New” tab instead, which showed us they did not understand what the charms were (both experienced and new users). </p>
                            <br><figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/function_of_charms_old.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <br><p>The recommendation we have to make the purpose of the charms more clear is to include the charm next to the event name on the Outlook calendar. This will show what the charm was used for, and will add some character to the event’s name. </p>
                            <br><br><figure style="display:inline-block">

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>I believe that implementing these changes into the Outlook service would make it much more usable and user-friendly, and I hope more usability testing can be conducted to learn more about these issues! Personally this has been a great experience, especially learning how to run a full-scope usability test with professional software like Morae.

                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>Earthquakes are a probable threat here in the Pacific Northwest and across the globe. Disaster recovery is a complex process that many college students often do not know about or have little understanding of. Because games have already been used to teach various topics, so this opens an opportunity for the development of a game designed to teach players about earthquake recovery. </p> 
                            <p>The game we created, RECOVERY: Earthquake Edition, is a fun and engaging card game that educates its players about the important and sometimes unknown earthquake recovery elements, including cooperation, challenges, and improvements. For the creation of this game, we recived the UW College of Engineering Grant as well as the HCDE Capstone People's Choice Award. Here is a video about our project!</p>

                            <h3>Game Overview</h3>
                            <p>RECOVERY: Earthquake Edition is a 3-4 player card game that is both competitive and cooperative. An earthquake has just hit the region and each player is an Emergency Manager who must rebuild their city individually and their communities together with their neighbors. Players must navigate obstacles slowing down their recovery, strategize about which resources to save, communicate with others, and think ahead to building back better than before. The game ends when the first player finishes rebuilding their city and two communities. However, the player with the most points wins the game! </p>

                            <h3>Research</h3>
                            <p>Through a literature review on disaster recovery and educational games and a competitive analysis of existing board games, we learned about aspects of the complex recovery process and various game formats. We surveyed 54 college students on their perception of recovery and their game preferences. We found 65% believed recovery was about returning to “normal” and only 7% mentioned improvements. Also, 78% liked competitive games, and 69% liked having teams.</p>

                            <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
                            <p>We sought to incorporate two major elements of recovery: the long timeframe and the idea of building back better. We brainstormed combinations of recovery concepts and game elements influenced by our research. Following both Affinity Diagrams and subsequent Persona creation, we chose to adapt a Board Game called Touring because it enabled us to incorporate recovery concepts and alter game mechanics, and matched our user survey findings. </p>

                            <p>We further refined our brainstorm of combinations by using our research results and Touring to guide our selection. We created a set of game instructions, a reference guide, and 24 unique cards. We printed a total of 177 low fidelity cards in preparation for usability testing.</p>

                            <p>We conducted two usability tests with a total of 7 undergraduate participants. From our evaluations, we discovered our game needed clearer instructions and more recovery content. Our findings led to multiple changes to the game instructions, three design changes to existing cards, and the creation of the TRADE card. This lead to our High-Fidelity Prototype complete with colored printable cards and game instructions, all of which you can view at the link below!</p>

                            <h3>Important Cards</h3>
                            <h4 style="color:blue">Coordination Card</h4>
                            <p>In any disaster recovery process, multiple groups, including businesses, nonprofits, and local and national governments, must work together to recover the community. Therefore, the COORDINATION card is required for a player to begin any building because coordination is a key part of recovery. </p>
                            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/QrqRwl0.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4 style="color:blue">City Building Cards</h4>
                            <p>Each player is the Emergency Manager for a city and is expected to rebuild it completely by accumulating 10 city cards. They need 4 HOUSE, 2 BUSINESS, 2 FIRE STATION, and 2 SCHOOL cards. </p>
                            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/j9nlzTF.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4 style="color:blue">Freeway Card</h4>
                            <p>You must play a FREEWAY card to begin building a community. To play a FREEWAY card, you must have a visible COORDINATION card at the time. When you have both COORDINATION and FREEWAY cards visible, you may begin laying down community building cards on the side where that FREEWAY card is placed. </p>
                            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/dcouDXG.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4 style="color:blue">Community Building Cards</h4>
                            <p>In reality, many people work together to recover their community. In this game, each player must also work with their neighboring Emergency Managers to build the communities between them. For a structure to be completely built, two neighbors must have a matching pair of that community building card. For a community to be considered complete, 4 matching pairs are required. The 4 community building cards are MEDICAL CENTER, LIGHT RAIL, SEWAGE SYSTEM, and AIRPORT. </p>
                            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/F9b02Im.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4 style="color:blue">Trade Card</h4>
                            <p>The TRADE card allows a player the option to request a trade with another player. Many times different cities have resources that could be of value to other cities, and negotiation is a large part of real world cooperation in post-disaster recovery situations. When a player plays a TRADE card, they can ask another player if they want to trade one card from their respective hands. When asked, the player has the option to decline, but there are no rules against making agreements or negotiations throughout the game to capitalize on the use of these TRADE cards, just like in real life. </p>
                            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ULLWtoB.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4 style="color:blue">Improvement Cards</h4>
                            <p>Improvement cards allow players to build back better because building to the same state prior to the earthquake may lead to the same vulnerabilities. Rebuilding quickly does not always mean recovering best. The winner is the player with the most points and improvement cards earn players bonus points. The city improvements are SOLAR PANEL and THEATRE. The community improvements are STADIUM and TOURIST ATTRACTION. All improvement cards require certain cards to already be placed because more vital structures should exist before some improvements are made. </p>
                            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/YUW7Iqi.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/6Mvq1ou.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4 style="color:blue">Red Cards</h4>
                            <p>As in reality, obstacles can interfere with a player’s recovery process. The red cards, DELAYED DECISION, LOW RESOURCES, and ACCIDENT, can be used against an opponent to slow down their recovery. The first two cards prevent all building by blocking the COORDINATION card. The ACCIDENT card blocks the FREEWAY, preventing community building. To resume building, players must use the appropriate solution card: DECISION REACHED, FUNDS ACQUIRED, or TOW TRUCK and then play another COORDINATION or FREEWAY card.  </p>

                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>Many of my friends and peers have had trouble finding study spaces on campus that meet all of their needs. I wanted to learn what users think about dorm, library, and classroom study spaces on campus, how they use those spaces, and how to make those spaces more effective for them. This figure is a summary of my research. If you would like to learn more about my approach and methods, keep scrolling!</p>
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Capture.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h3>Field Research</h3>
                                <p>My core approach to my field research was three deep hanging out observation sessions in three different types of study spaces; Savery Hall, Odegaard Library, and Alder Commons. I chose to do deep hanging out because I felt that integration in the environment would give me a better impression of the atmosphere, benefits, and costs of each study space. 
                                I took extensive notes of everything I was seeing in the study environment, using a laptop to blend in as well as to take notes as quickly as possible.</p>
                                <p>My note taking was broken down into observations of the setting (to give context) and observations of the users. In each space I was in, I would start by giving a description of the setting for context. I would then isolate each user in my field of vision, and describe everything I saw them doing in the study space, for example studying, playing games, or interacting with others. Upon entering each space, I made sure to choose a spot where I had access to as much user data as possible. </p>
                                <p>I used covert observation, and did not ask any of the users for consent to observe them. For the same reason as to why I did not choose to use contextual injury, I did not want to interfere with natural study/work habits by making subjects self-conscious as a result of my presence (Taylor & Bogdan, 1984). 
                                That being said, I made sure not to use any specific names or information that could link my observations to an individual.</p>
                                <p>Each of these sessions lasted 1.5 hours for a total of 4.5 hours of observations. At each site I observed three different locations for 0.5 hours each, giving me access to many different users within each space. Each 1.5 hour session was completed on a separate day at the exact same time of 9:00 PM. This approach allowed me to isolate students as my main target user (given that many students study late), and make sure that I was able to access the classroom setting as a study space and not a teaching space.</p> 
                                <p>I chose Savery, Odegaard, and Alder Commons because they are the most popular study spaces for their given study space type (classroom, library, and dorm respectively). After completing my observations at these locations, I highlighted different themes in my notes and tallied up users who fit into those themes on a separate sheet of paper to get quantitative results from my qualitative observations.</p>

                            <h3>Interviews</h3>
                                <p>The overall approach I used in my interviews was three 30 minute semi-structured interviews of three participants. 
                                In doing my interviews this way, I was able to ask questions to elicit further details, but also had a general interview structure that was consistent for each participant. I was able to ask all seven of my core questions in addition to follow up questions, which I asked based on individual responses to my core questions. </p>
                                <p>Before I conducted my interviews, I informed participants that their information would be confidential and that I would not record any identifying information. 
                                I took notes on my laptop of what each participant was saying, asking the participant to pause if I needed to catch up so I could record word for word responses. I asked permission to record these responses, and informed participants that if they felt like they did not want to answer or wanted to leave at any time they had the right to do so.</p>
                                <p>I also let them know ahead of time what the study was about and that there were no incentives involved. I attempted to be as neutral of an investigator as possible, and told the participants to be honest with their responses. This was to provide more valid data as well as reduce biases such as social desirability bias where participants may decide to provide socially acceptable answers that aren’t necessarily true, and prestige response bias where participants may try and impress me as the interviewer (Baxter, Courage, & Caine, 2005).</p>
                                <p>I recruited participants over Facebook, and constrained recruitment to current UW students. My first participant was a 21 year old female, my second was a 19 year old female, and my last was also a 19 year old female. Having only female participants of similar age gave consistency across interviews, all of which I conducted the same evening, one after another, in a Poplar Hall study room. 
                                Though conducting my research in a dorm study space was potentially biasing, it was the most convenient location for all of my subjects.</p>
                                <p>After completing the interviews, I did an Affinity Diagram, starting by identifying specific information from my interviews that could be applicable across participants. I then further specified these ideas on notecards which I organized into generalized categories. I wrote a participant ID on a card if their data was in accordance with the theme, and I finally identified four common themes based on the ideas that were shared across participants, only making inferences on themes backed by at least 2/3 of participants.</p>

                            <h3>Survey</h3>
                                <p>The recruitment process for my survey occurred over Facebook, which I chose hoping that my being friends with the participants would make them more likely to respond with honest answers. Also, since it is a popular social media platform, it made the surveys easy to access and complete. I utilized a Google Forms survey because it is an easy to use survey creation tool, including multiple question types for more varied answers and an attractive interface which I felt users would want to interact with.</p>
                                <p>I excluded participants that were not UW students and had never used a campus study space through the first two questions. By doing this I hoped to only include ideal participants, those being current UW students who specifically study using study spaces on campus, so that I could best learn about which spaces they use and how they use them.</p>

                                <p>Winston & Strawn LLC hired West Monroe Partners (2 UX Designers including myself, 3 Developers, 1 Architect, 1 Project Manager, and 1 Engagement Lead) to completely redesign their existing intranet. In the words of Winston CIO David Cunningham the goal was, "Evolving our traditional app-store-like intranet into a personalized site for intelligence delivery, client service, and visible status of what’s happening with clients and around the firm."</p>
                            <h3>Requirements Gathering Workshops</h3>
                                <p>The first step was gathering requirements on the clients needs. This involved workshops with the client to define a product vision for both employees of Winston, and clients of Winston. Additionally, this involved mapping out key high-level site requirements that we could use to inform our subsequent persona research.</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <a href="https://github.com/khalilsomani/khalilsomani.github.io/blob/master/img/Offical%20Responsive%20Template%20Code.html" target="_blank"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/web-trifecta_html5_css3_js-strict.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 710px"></a>
                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p> During my time as a Technical Specialist Intern at Datstat, I was asked to create a custom survey template to replace the current one. Despite it being the most up-to-date survey version, it contained many flaws in design and execution that the company felt a fellow intern and I could impove with custom Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
                            <p>The template we created is completely mobile-friendy in addition to being desktop-friendly. Below I will describe what changes and additions we implemented, and give a link to our code. Our survey template has already been integrated into the surveys of major clients and will soon be the default for Datstat Illume software.</p>
                            <h3>Major Adjustments</h3>
                            <p>Here are some of the major changes we made to the old survey template. We created a way to display survey loops in a table, which represents repeated sections of surveys that clients can ask to trigger under specific circumstances. We also used Javascript to make it so that the footer does not float up with the last question, instead always staying at the bottom of every page. This occurs even when programmers press F12 to inspect page elements. We also used custom formatting on survey prompts, response options, and titles for more fluid and appealing interaction. The first picture below is an example from the old template, and the second is from the new template we created.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <div class="grow"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Screenshot1_new.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="border:2px solid red" alt=""></div>
                            </figure>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <div class="grow"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Screenshot1_real.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="border:2px solid red" alt=""></div>
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Mobile Accordian Rendering</h3>
                            <p>In the old template, questions were not designed to be space efficient for mobile use, and it would sometimes take full minutes to scroll through response options and reach the bottom of the page. Using Javascript, we created an accordian rendering so that question prompts could be grouped together until they are tapped, at which point they would expand, revealing response options. The first picture below is the new template version before any prompts are tapped, and the second picture is the result of tapping on a prompt.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/acordian1_real1.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="width:300px" alt="">
                            </figure>

                            </figure>
                            <h3>Text Elements and Buttons</h3>
                            <p>In the old survey template, text elements that were created by survey programmers took up a great deal of space, even when they didn't contain anything. We fixed that, and in addition created a way for Next, Save, and Previous buttons to be vertically displayed in mobile to reduce the need for a horizontal scroll. The first picture is an example from the old template, the second is an example from the new template illustrating reduced text element space, and the third illustrates new mobile buttons.</p>

                            <h3>Mobile Question Tables</h3>
                            <p>Question tables are a way to organize survey questions in a way that include multiple prompts and response option sets. In the old template, the rendering of these tables for mobile had very strange text hierarchies where inner prompts were larger than headings. We changed this to be a more user-friendly hierarchy. Here is a picture of the new, cleaner structure we came up with.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/prompt_real1.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="width:300px" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Likert Scale Questions</h3>
                            <p>On the Solutions Consulting Team, one of my main jobs was to come up with custom solutions for clients. After a client asked for a likert question scale, we realized that the old survey template did not accomodate likert scales, so we built them into the new template. Here is a picture of this new question functionality.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">
                            <div class="grow"><img src="khalilsomani.github.io/img/Screenshot4.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="border:2px solid red" alt=""></div>
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Commentaries</h3>
                            <p>Another question type is commentaries, which allow for long text entries. In the old version, there was very little space alotted for this, so we enlarged the boxes in the new template. The first picture below is an example from the old template, the second picture is from the new template.</p>
                            <figure style="display:inline-block">

                            </figure>
                            <h3>End Page Content</h3>
                            <p>Lastly, every survey has an end page that lets the participant know they are done with the survey. The previous version said, "Thank you", but gave no more information. In our version, we used this space to provide a link so that the survey could be edited and added to by the user at a later time, including a place for the user to enter their email so that the link could be sent straight to them. The first picture below is an example of the old end page content, and the second picture is an example from our new template.</p>

                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                                <p>Our roomates keep stealing our food, so we decided to put an end to that. Food Block is the best defense against unwanted snackery, perfect for protecting your favorite cookies, candies and other treats from unruly roommates and family members. With Food Block, you can monitor your food's safety from afar using a remote, and be alerted when its stolen. Your food has never been safer! </p>
                            <img src="http://foodblockhcde.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/6/7/106783497/6ed30aa9-0fa9-4075-8d7a-232600562ac9_orig.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h3>Physical Computing</h3>
                                <p>My partner Alison Chiu and I worked to build Food Block (Site 2) along with two other teams, one of which built a remote to interact with Food Block (Site 1) and another which built a UI to visualize Food Block data (Command Center). Our site features a box constructed out of laser cut acrylic which is able to sense when the box is open and if there is food inside. This was done with a Hall Effect Sensor which checks if the box is opened through a magnetic latch, and sets off an alarm through a speaker if the box is opened without being disarmed first via Site 1.</p>
                            <p>When the box is opened, an LED Strip lights up and a pressure plate on the bottom of the box detects a change in weight to determine whether or not something is present. If the user puts food into the box, they can also reset the alarm. The box also features an LCD display to show the box’s status and messages from the command center, as well as an XBee to receive and send signals to the command center about the box’s status. Here is a video that demonstrates what our product does.</p>

                            <h3>Breadboard Layout</h3>

                            <h3>Implementation</h3>
                            <p>Our LCD screen is used to show when the box was armed, disarmed, in a cautionary state, and alarmed (when food has been stolen). Our Block also has an addressable LED strip. We hold this LED strip at an armed state of green when food is present and the lid was closed. We make it a flashing blue when the box is disarmed and food can be added or removed at will without triggering anything.</p>
                            <p>We made it a flashing red when the lid is opened but the food is still in place as a kind of “warning” state if the box was previously in an armed state. And finally, we made it a flashing red with a synchronized speaker buzz occurring during each flash when food is removed and the box was previously in an armed state. Both the speaker and LED strip are connected to an Arduino which is sitting under an acrylic panel at the bottom. Flushed to the top of this bottom panel is a pressure sensor, which we used to detect whether an object is placed on the box or removed from the box. </p>

                            <p>We also used a hall effects sensor which resides behind another panel at the front of the box. Both of these sensors are connected to the Arduino via long wires that we soldered onto the sensors. A knob at the very top of the box lid holds the magnet which can be detected by the hall effects sensor, and we glued this magnet into the knob so that it can sense every time the box is closed. The code is written so that if the presence of the magnet is sensed, the box is in a closed state in which it will not alarm in any way. We also use an xBee to communicate with the Command Center and Remote.</p>

                            <p>For the actual build of the Food Block, we used laser cut dark blue acrylic for the upper section of the box, and a white acrylic for the bottom of the box which allows 60% of light through so that the lights from the LED strip can be seen. The lid of the box is an opaque white acrylic that does not allow light to pass through. Acrylic cement was used to seal all of the panels together. The joints connected the lid to the rest of the box are also acrylic joints for easy sealing to the back of the box with the same acrylic cement.</p>

                            <h3>Code</h3>   
                            <p>The box first checks with the remote if it has been disarmed, and if it has been, it does nothing and allows the user to add/remove objects without setting off any alarms. If the box is armed, the box begins flashing when opened and adds a beeping element if the object is removed.</p>
                            <p>The final code was organized in a modular fashion so that it would be easier to call each of the functions, rather than through a number of 'if' statements. Initially, we approached it logically based on the motions the user would use to open the box, and if it was locked or not. This was revised by making it modular and easier to understand what function was being called when. Additionally, this allowed for greater communication and made it easier for debugging.

                                <p>As a UI/UX Design Intern at Datstat, I used Adobe Illustrator and Balsamiq to wireframe and create low and high fidelity mockups of interfaces and interactions for incoming software platforms, patient portals, and client-facing applications. Here are elements from four sample projects that I have created on the job and was given permission to share.</p>
                            <h3>Patient Messenger</h3>
                                <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I designed a mobile messenger system so that patients could interact with their health care providers in the most efficient way possible. Here is one set of my wireframe progressions, focusing on setting-based interaction.</p>

                                <p>Using Balsamiq, I desiged a solution to a software issue for a desktop client, and the wireframe interaction process is shown. As the software was, changing tasks in a given workflow caused all task information to be deleted. I designed an error message system and task/activity layout to make changing tasks and the risks of doing so more apparent to the user.</p>
